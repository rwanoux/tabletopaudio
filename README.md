# simple integration of TableTop Audio

https://youtu.be/qmza8ESjr08

## please read carefully

### this module isn't anymore fully functionnal

the website Tabletop Audio changed its configuration in order to block other website (or applications) to display its content.
What does it imply ?
If your are running your GM session thru a browser, it won't work at all, period.
If you are running your GM session thru the electron based foundry application, it can work, but not for all soundpads.

For Players : a new tab will be opened (if the player has allowed the browser to do that), the player have to click the "connect" button. If the browser isn't allowed to open browser, the player just have to follow the link that appear , then connect.

In order to respect TableTop audio's developper work and will ; this module will be removed from the official foundry package list. Sorry guys :(
